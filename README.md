# Overview

This repository is dedicated to housing a collection of algorithms that I teach during my algorithmics classes. It includes implementations in both Python and C++. The primary goal of this repository is to provide comprehensive examples and solutions to help students grasp the intricacies of algorithms and problem-solving.

## Language

All the implementations in this repository are available in both Python and C++. The choice of these languages is driven by their versatility and suitability for algorithmic problem-solving.

## Contents

The algorithms in this repository are organized into two separate files: one in Python (`.py`) and another in C++ (`.cpp`). Each file contains a collection of algorithms, ensuring modularity and ease of access.

## How to Use

To make the most of this repository, navigate to the relevant file, review the code, and study the associated explanations. These resources can serve as references, learning aids, and starting points for your own algorithmic solutions.

## Disclaimer

The algorithms provided here are intended solely for educational purposes. They are not meant to encourage plagiarism or cheating in any academic or competitive programming settings. Students are encouraged to attempt problem-solving independently before consulting these resources.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to the algorithmics community and fellow educators for fostering an environment of learning and skill development.
